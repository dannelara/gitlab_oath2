# Assignment WT - OAuth

The ability to delegate access between systems is central in modern web applications. One popular standard f√∂r access delegation is OAuth (Open Authorization). The OAuth flow can seem complicated at first glance, but it is essential to understand the different stakeholder's (client/consumer/service provider) involvement and communication.

## The assignment

Your assignment is to implement a three-legged OAuth2 access delegation between a server-side rendered web application (the consumer) and GitLab (the service provider).

The user should be able to log in on the consumer application using her gitlab.lnu.se account (#10) and show some basic profile information (#11), including at least the 101 most recent GitLab activities (#12).

You are not allowed to use any external packages/modules that have built-in support for OAuth (#2).

## Requirements

Make sure to read [all requirements of the application](../../issues/). This includes: (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12)
Pay extra attention to the labels indicating if the requirement is required (~"req::required") or optional (~"req::optional").

In this assignment, you must close issues and tasks ([ ]) that you implement. You must also create your issues (and close them) if you add any functionality.
